#### Introduction
Webpack is a module bundler. It examines all of the modules in your application, creates a dependency graph, then intelligently puts all of them together into one or more bundle(s) that your index.html file can reference.

#### Installation
Create Directory, and init `package.json`

    mkdir webpack-demo
    cd webpack-demo/
    npm init

Install webpack

    npm i webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server --save-dev

#### Configuring webpack
package.json

    "scripts": {
      "dev": "webpack --mode development",
      "start": "webpack serve --mode production",

Run wbepack, you get error, normal!

    npm run dev

Create src/index.html
~~~html   
    <html>
      <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
~~~
Create src/index.js
~~~js
    console.log("Hello webpack!")

    let root = document.getElementById('root')
    root.innerHTML = 'Hi, this is a Webpack Demo!!'
~~~

reRun wbepack: dist/main.js will be generated

Install html plugin

    npm i html-webpack-plugin --save-dev

Create and config `webpack.config.js`
~~~js
    module.exports = {
    entry: { index: path.resolve(__dirname, "src", "index.js") },
    output: {
                path: path.resolve(__dirname, "build")
            },
    
    plugins: [
            new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
                template: path.resolve(__dirname, "src", "index.html")
            })
            ],
~~~
